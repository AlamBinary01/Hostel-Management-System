Hostel Management System
Project Statement: 
Hostel management system offers a full featured accommodation system to efficiently manage the entire residential facility in the university of college. Reducing the staff &amp; paper works, this accommodation software will keep the updated records of students, their meal, lodging, transfer room and other facilities. The software allocates rooms to the registered students based on them preferences and records their details of using food, lodging and other facilities along with fee and other advance payment details. The system also gathers feedback on the room, food and other amenities on a regular basis and sends fee reminders to all registered students. This hostel management system monitors attendance, disciplinary logs, room charge status and check-in check-out in hostel premises.
Project Based on:
       	 C#, and Oracle project on Hostel management system is a C# based Project and it has been developed in ASP, C# and Oracle and we can manage Hostel Facilities, Payment, Rent, beds, Room, and hostel from this project.
Main Objective:
The objectives of the automated Hostel Management System are to simplify the day-to-day processes of the hostel. The system will be able to handle many services to take care of all students in a quick manner. As a solution to the large amount of file handling happening at the hostel, the manual error occurs with increased number of students, this software will be used to overcome those drawbacks with a computerized system. Security, insertion, deletion and most importantly the efficiency of information retrieval is some benefits the development team going to present within this system. The system should be user appropriate and have an overall end user high subjective satisfaction.
